### 🖥️ Multi‑Screen Improvements
- Target Display shows all secondary screens with status tags:
  - “In‑use: Timer” when used by Timer Control
  - “In‑use: Overlay” when broadcasting overlay
  - “Available” for free screens
- Display list refreshes when opening Overlay Control

### 🧭 Navigation & Guides
- Full‑page Guide with two sections: Timer Control Guide and Overlay Control Guide
- Guide opens directly to the relevant section from each module


> Tip: You can run Timer Control on one screen and Program Info on another. Use Target Display selectors to route each output independently.

## 💬 Story: How This Was Built
It began in my church—we needed a simple way to show a timer and manage services efficiently. Most options we found were paid, limited, or simply not tailored for church workflows. I asked: what if I build something churches can use for free, with the features we actually need?

By the grace of God, this app came to life and has served us faithfully ever since. It continues to grow with real‑world feedback from church and live‑event use. I’m John O., and I keep this free and open source so anyone can fork, improve, and bless their community.

If you build on this, please share your improvements! PRs are welcome.
